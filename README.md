# Minimal

Minimal is the minimal theme to get things done.
This version of minimal is based on Dracula theme.

## Additional configuration 

I like the following coloured brackets configuration with this theme:

```
    "bracketPairColorizer.consecutivePairColors": [
        "()",
        "[]",
        "{}",
        [
            "#f1fa8c",
            "#ffb86c",
            "#ff79c6",
            "#8be9fd",
        ],
        "Red"
    ]
```
